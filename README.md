# method to change root
This worked for me, and kept all my history intact. From the incorrect root folder (the parent where you accidentally initialized the repo):

- Move the folder:

mv .git thecorrectfolder/

- Re-initialize the git repo:

cd thecorrectfolder/

git init

- Re-add all the files, commit, and push:

git add .

git commit -am 'fixing things'

git push origin master

- Done! Get yourself a beer.

When you commit the git repo after re-initializing, you'll get a bunch of output that looks like this:

rename {ethanode/coffee => coffee}/app.coffee (100%)
In other words, all of your references from the parent folder and being renamed to use the correct folder.
